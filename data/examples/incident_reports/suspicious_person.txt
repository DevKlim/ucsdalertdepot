Incident Report
Date: March 23, 2025
Time: 3:15 PM

Location: Geisel Library, 2nd floor, west wing

I am reporting a suspicious individual who has been wandering around the library for the past hour. 
This person appears to be in their 30s, wearing a dark hoodie and a backpack. They have been looking 
into study rooms and examining unattended belongings. When approached by library staff, they claimed 
to be looking for a friend but couldn't provide a name. The person has been seen attempting to open 
several backpacks when students stepped away momentarily.

The individual is currently still in the building, moving between the 2nd and 3rd floors. They appear 
to be targeting areas where students leave belongings unattended while using the restroom or getting 
food. No thefts have been confirmed yet, but the behavior is concerning.

Campus security has been verbally notified but I wanted to submit a formal report as well.
