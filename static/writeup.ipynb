        "In this project, we aim to address a core question: **How can we effectively gather, process, and visualize real-time safety alerts and police reports around UC San Diego (UCSD) in order to improve campus-wide awareness and foster better decision-making?** Our project is informed by the observation that although UCSD publishes timely warnings and local police reports, the existing channels (email or text messages, mainly) do not provide a user-friendly, geospatial view of incidents. This creates information gaps regarding exactly where and when incidents occurred, and does little to assist newcomers or visitors in navigating campus safely.\n",
        "\n",
        "The intended audience includes UCSD students, faculty, staff, and visitors, as well as broader community members who traverse campus daily. By unifying these alerts into a live, interactive dashboard, we seek to provide an easily accessible and up-to-date view of campus safety. The business case for this solution centers on enhancing campus security and situational awareness in a cost-effective manner, leveraging open-source tools and local large language models (LLMs) to protect sensitive data. Furthermore, by offering a geospatial perspective, we allow the campus community to pinpoint historical hotspots and potential emerging threats in real time. This, in turn, fosters a greater sense of autonomy and personal safety.\n",
        "\n",
        "Compared to standard text alerts, an interactive map that displays incident type, severity, and location is far more intuitive, especially for non-technical users. With additional functionalities such as multi-lingual support (enabled by LLMs) and crowdsourcing of minor incident reports, the platform holds the potential to transform how safety information is disseminated and used on campus. It is relevant not only to law enforcement and campus officials, who can view trends and allocate resources more effectively, but also to students, who can adjust their daily commutes or evening schedules based on real-time data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ultimately, our question addresses the gap between raw campus police information and a polished, user-friendly tool for campus safety. By building a comprehensive solution, we stand to make safety data more actionable, timely, and transparent, thereby contributing to a safer campus community.\n"

First, research by Akter and Wamba (2019) explores how integrating big data sources in disaster and crisis management can markedly increase responsiveness and situational awareness [[Link]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10479-017-2584-2). Their findings underscore the importance of combining various data streams—such as campus police logs and 911 calls—to provide a comprehensive picture of an evolving threat landscape.\n",

However, our system distinguishes itself by harnessing local LLMs for data privacy and advanced semantic understanding of campus-centric location names.\n",

We hope to adapt their principles of community engagement and data validation for a campus environment where user-generated reports might complement official police data.\n",

When an address is too ambiguous for external APIs to resolve, our campus map dictionary bridges the gap.\n",
        "4. **Data Fusion & Deduplication**: We merge newly scraped records with existing historical data, removing duplicates or re-published alerts. Each record is assigned a unique ID.\n",
        "5. **Exploratory Statistics**: We compute frequency distributions of crime types (theft, burglary, assault, etc.), time-of-day patterns, and location clusters. We map the incidents to see if certain areas like parking garages or residential halls see higher rates of specific incidents.\n",
        "6. **Temporal & Spatial Visualization**: Using Folium or Leaflet, we display an interactive map where each marker corresponds to an incident. We add a timeline slider enabling the user to see how incidents shift by hour/day. For advanced analyses, we might compute kernel density estimates to see hotspots.\n",
        "7. **LLM-Based Interpretation**: We experiment with a local language model (like a Mistral or GPT-2 fine-tuned on UCSD building references) to parse location strings such as “Near the Sun God statue behind Peterson Hall” and produce refined lat/lon estimates, especially when standard gazetteers fail.\n",

These findings corroborate earlier assumptions that visible, high-density regions of campus might require special attention or safety measures. Overall, our integrated approach to data ingestion, processing, and visualization underscores the potential for real-time geographic alert systems to enhance campus safety and awareness.\n"

        "Our findings echo Akter and Wamba (2019), who emphasize that timely integration of multiple data streams—like UCSD official logs, city-wide stats, and even crowdsourced tips—can significantly improve the speed and depth of situational awareness. While we only partly integrated crowd-sourced incident reporting, future expansions could further bolster campus safety intelligence. Similarly, Alert2Me’s concept of immediate, location-based notifications aligns with our web dashboard approach, albeit ours is primarily map-centric and campus-tailored.\n",

        "We also drew lessons from Ushahidi deployments, which stress the importance of user-friendly mapping tools. By focusing on building-level accuracy, we went beyond many general crime mapping platforms (e.g., CrimeMapping.com) that often operate at the block level. Our results confirm that hyper-local context fosters more immediate relevance to the campus population, addressing an important gap highlighted in prior campus safety research.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2) Trade-Offs and Decision Points\n",
        "One trade-off involved location privacy. We show precise markers at campus buildings, which may risk over-disclosure if victim addresses are too detailed. Our compromise is to only geocode publicly known areas (e.g., the dorm building’s main address, not a specific dorm room). We also faced the challenge of balancing advanced LLM usage vs. a simpler dictionary-based geocoding approach. The latter proved more reliable for known building names, while LLM solutions might handle ambiguous or colloquial references better.\n",

        "Another key decision was using Folium for a quick demonstration within this notebook, rather than implementing a more robust front-end framework with MapLibre or deck.gl. For scalability, we may later adopt a higher-performance solution. Ultimately, each step involved balancing complexity, cost, and the unique demands of a dynamic campus environment.\n"

        "Our initial research question—whether we could create an effective, real-time dashboard for UCSD Police Alerts—has largely been answered. We successfully developed a pipeline that scrapes the official UCSD Police pages, normalizes the incident data, and visualizes it on an interactive map. In doing so, we demonstrated that hyper-local geocoding is both feasible and indispensable for an environment where mainstream geocoding solutions lack the precision needed for building-level accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "That said, there remain opportunities to further refine our system. First, we would like to integrate city-level 911 call data, bridging campus-specific alerts with broader regional crime trends. Second, adding a crowdsourcing module could empower students and staff to submit reports directly, although this raises questions about data validation, potential misuse, and privacy considerations. Third, the use of OCR to extract building labels from campus maps can be improved by training a specialized model for campus map fonts or implementing better text pre-processing routines. Fourth, as we scale, switching to a real-time push notification system (e.g., WebSockets) could ensure the campus community sees new alerts within moments of their publication.\n",

        "Eventually, we envision a single platform that merges official UCSD alerts with city-wide data streams, user-generated tips, and advanced analytics, possibly using clustering and predictive models to forecast potential hotspots. Through these expansions, our approach might generalize to other campuses or communities where accurate, timely, and privacy-conscious incident mapping is paramount. Overall, we believe that continued iteration in data sources, geocoding intelligence, and user engagement will help the platform evolve into a robust, indispensable resource for campus safety.\n"
