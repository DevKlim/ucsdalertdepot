Project Brainstorm:
real-time amber alert/triton alert map – expand to city level?
make an easily integrable tool to display on any website/app – start with webpage
911 reports -> geographical points/polygons for visualization so anyone could be notified – community based crisis response, so people are more aware of things that happen in their community and can respond quickly
ex) 911 call for old patient with stroke -> nearby certified medical assistants could help before official ambulance comes.
ex) 911 call for active shooter -> more people are well aware and will actively avoid area
Goal: have the website create easy api calls for other websites/apps (news outlets or google) to implement as their own feature -> people become more aware of nearby crime/emergencies
addition: democratized/crowd-sourcing crisis mapping – people can report crises (i.e. a fire), and others can reinforce/report on it real time (like how google maps reports and confirms the locations of accidents or stalled vehicles)
we won’t have real time data, but can work with historical data first to visualize where things have happened
